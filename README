# d3d11_player experiments

## Building

1. download latest build at https://artifacts.videolan.org/vlc/nightly-win64-llvm/
2. extract libvlc.dll, libvlccore.dll, sdk folder and plugins folder to d3d11_player repo root
3. run ./build.sh from linux with mingw installed will create a d3d11_player.exe

## Current issue repro
1. start .exe
2. when the video starts, press 's'. This will seek near the end so we reach the end without waiting so much.
3. when the last frame is displayed, press 'n'. This should start a new playback in the existing window, but instead creates a new HWND.
